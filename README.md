Gamepads is a Flutter plugin to handle gamepad (or joystick) input across multiple platforms.

It supports multiple simultaneously connected gamepads, and will automatically detect and listen to
new connections.


## Getting Started

The `list` method will list all currently connected gamepads:

```dart
  final gamepads = await Gamepads.list();
  // ...
```

This uses the data class `GamepadController`, which has an `id` and a user-facing `name`.

And the `events` stream will broadcast input events from all gamepads:

```dart
  Gamepads.events.listen((event) {
    // ...
  });
```

You can also listen to events only for a specific gamepad with `eventsByGamepad`.

Events are described by the data class `GamepadEvent`:

```dart
class GamepadEvent {
  /// The id of the gamepad controller that fired the event.
  final String gamepadId;

  /// The timestamp in which the event was fired, in milliseconds since epoch.
  final int timestamp;

  /// The [KeyType] of the key that was triggered.
  final KeyType type;

  /// A platform-dependant identifier for the key that was triggered.
  final String key;

  /// The current value of the key.
  final double value;

  // ...
}
```


## Next Steps

As mentioned, this is still a WIP library. Not only APIs are expected to change if needed, but we
 plan to add more features, like:

- stream to listen for connecting/disconnecting gamepads
- get current state of a gamepad
- add support for web and even mobile

## Android Integration

The Android implementation requires the application's Activity to forward input events (and
input devices) to the plugin. Below is an example of a MainActivity for a clean Flutter project
that has implemented the required boilerplate code. For many projects it will be possible to simply
duplicate this setup.

```dart
package [YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME]

import android.hardware.input.InputManager
import android.os.Handler
import android.view.InputDevice
import android.view.KeyEvent
import android.view.MotionEvent
import io.flutter.embedding.android.FlutterActivity
import org.flame_engine.gamepads_android.GamepadsCompatibleActivity

class MainActivity: FlutterActivity(), GamepadsCompatibleActivity {
    var keyListener: ((KeyEvent) -> Boolean)? = null
    var motionListener: ((MotionEvent) -> Boolean)? = null

    override fun dispatchGenericMotionEvent(motionEvent: MotionEvent): Boolean {
        return motionListener?.invoke(motionEvent) ?: false
    }
    
    override fun dispatchKeyEvent(keyEvent: KeyEvent): Boolean {
        return keyListener?.invoke(keyEvent) ?: false
    }

    override fun registerInputDeviceListener(
      listener: InputManager.InputDeviceListener, handler: Handler?) {
        val inputManager = getSystemService(INPUT_SERVICE) as InputManager
        inputManager.registerInputDeviceListener(listener, null)
    }

    override fun registerKeyEventHandler(handler: (KeyEvent) -> Boolean) {
        keyListener = handler
    }

    override fun registerMotionEventHandler(handler: (MotionEvent) -> Boolean) {
        motionListener = handler
    }
}

```
