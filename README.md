Gamepads is a Flutter plugin to handle gamepad (or joystick) input across multiple platforms.

It supports multiple simultaneously connected gamepads, and will automatically detect and listen to
new connections.


## Platform Support

| Platform | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Android  | Supported |
| iOS      | Supported |
| macOS    | Supported |
| Linux    | Supported |
| Windows  | Supported |
| Web      | Supported |


## Getting Started

The `list` method will list all currently connected gamepads:

```dart
  final gamepads = await Gamepads.list();
  // ...
```

This uses the data class `GamepadController`, which has an `id` and a user-facing `name`.
It also reports `vendorId` and `productId` where the platform provides them, so you can
identify a connected gamepad (e.g. "Sony DualSense") before it sends any input. These are
`null` on macOS and iOS, where `GCController` does not expose vendor/product ids.

To react to gamepads being plugged in and unplugged instead of polling `list`,
listen to `onConnected` and `onDisconnected`:

```dart
Gamepads.onConnected.listen((event) {
  print('${event.name} (${event.gamepadId}) connected');
});

Gamepads.onDisconnected.listen((event) {
  print('${event.name} (${event.gamepadId}) disconnected');
});
```

Both are filtered views of `connectionEvents`, which emits a
`GamepadConnectionEvent` for either case:

```dart
class GamepadConnectionEvent {
  /// The id of the gamepad controller that was connected or disconnected.
  final String gamepadId;

  /// A user-facing, platform-dependant name for the gamepad controller.
  final String name;

  /// Whether the gamepad was connected or disconnected.
  final GamepadConnectionEventType type;
}
```

The `gamepadId` matches the `GamepadController.id` returned by `list` and the
`GamepadEvent.gamepadId` of the events fired by that gamepad. Only gamepads
that connect while your app is running are reported, so call `list` once at
startup to pick up the ones that were already connected.

Listen to `normalizedEvents` for gamepad input with consistent
button/axis names and value ranges across all platforms:

```dart
Gamepads.normalizedEvents.listen((event) {
  if (event.button == GamepadButton.a && event.value != 0) {
    print('A button pressed!');
  }
  if (event.axis == GamepadAxis.leftStickX) {
    print('Left stick X: ${event.value}');
  }
});
```

The platform is auto-detected. The `normalizedEvents` stream
is lazy — normalization only runs while there is an active
listener. When nobody is listening, no normalized events are
created.

To override the auto-detected platform, set a custom
normalizer before accessing `normalizedEvents`:

```dart
Gamepads.normalizer = GamepadNormalizer.forPlatform(
  GamepadPlatform.linux,
);
```


## Raw Events

If you need access to the underlying platform-specific events,
use the `events` stream instead. Note that raw key names and
value ranges differ across platforms (e.g., the A button is
`"0"` on Linux, `"a"` on Windows, `"a.circle"` on iOS and
macOS, `"KEYCODE_BUTTON_A"` on Android, and `"button 0"` on
Web).

```dart
  Gamepads.events.listen((event) {
    // ...
  });
```

You can also listen to events only for a specific gamepad with `eventsByGamepad`.

Events are described by the data class `GamepadEvent`:

```dart
class GamepadEvent {
  /// The id of the gamepad controller that fired the event.
  final String gamepadId;

  /// The timestamp in which the event was fired, in milliseconds since epoch.
  final int timestamp;

  /// The [KeyType] of the key that was triggered.
  final KeyType type;

  /// A platform-dependant identifier for the key that was triggered.
  final String key;

  /// The current value of the key.
  final double value;

  // ...
}
```

Normalized events always preserve the original raw event via
`NormalizedGamepadEvent.rawEvent`, so you can fall back to
platform-specific handling when needed.


## Standard Gamepad Model

Buttons and axes follow the Xbox/standard gamepad layout:

| Type     | Values                       | Range       |
|----------|------------------------------|-------------|
| `Button` | `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`           | 0.0 or 1.0  |
| `Button` | `leftBumper`, `rightBumper`  | 0.0 or 1.0  |
| `Button` | `leftTrigger`, `rightTrigger`| 0.0 or 1.0  |
| `Button` | `back`, `start`, `home`      | 0.0 or 1.0  |
| `Button` | `leftStick`, `rightStick`    | 0.0 or 1.0  |
| `Button` | `dpadUp/Down/Left/Right`     | 0.0 or 1.0  |
| `Button` | `touchpad`                   | 0.0 or 1.0  |
| `Axis`   | `leftStickX`, `leftStickY`   | -1.0 to 1.0 |
| `Axis`   | `rightStickX`, `rightStickY` | -1.0 to 1.0 |
| `Axis`   | `leftTrigger`, `rightTrigger`| 0.0 to 1.0  |

Buttons use 0.0 (released) and 1.0 (pressed).
Stick conventions: Left/Down = -1, Right/Up = +1.


## Platform Details

**iOS / macOS** — Both platforms are served by the same
`gamepads_darwin` implementation, which uses the GCController
API. Button and axis names are SF Symbols strings (e.g.
`a.circle`, `l.joystick`), which the normalizer matches by
pattern. `GCController` does not expose USB identifiers, so
`vendorId` and `productId` are always `null` on these
platforms.

**Android** — Uses `KeyEvent` and `MotionEvent` with
platform-defined key codes (e.g. `KEYCODE_BUTTON_A`,
`AXIS_X`). No device-specific lookup needed.

**Web** — Uses the W3C Gamepad API with the standard mapping.
Buttons and axes are reported as numeric indices (`button 0`,
`analog 0`).

**Windows** — Uses the
[GameInput API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/gdk/docs/reference/input/gameinput/gameinput_members)
v0 which provides consistent named keys (e.g. `a`, `leftThumbstickX`)
for all controllers. To compile for windows you need Windows SDK which
gets installed when you setup [Windows target for Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/windows/setup).
End users do not need Windows SDK.

**Linux** — Uses raw numeric joystick indices that vary by
controller hardware. The normalizer uses a bundled copy of
the community-maintained
[SDL GameController DB](https://github.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB)
to select the correct mapping by vendor/product ID (1500+
controllers). Unknown controllers fall back to an Xbox-like
layout. You can load additional mappings at runtime via
`ControllerDatabase.loadSdlMappings()`.

## Android Integration

The Android implementation requires the application's Activity to forward input events (and
input devices) to the plugin. Below is an example of a MainActivity for a clean Flutter project
that has implemented the required boilerplate code. For many projects it will be possible to simply
duplicate this setup.

```kotlin
package [YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME]

import android.hardware.input.InputManager
import android.os.Handler
import android.view.InputDevice
import android.view.KeyEvent
import android.view.MotionEvent
import io.flutter.embedding.android.FlutterActivity
import org.flame_engine.gamepads_android.GamepadsCompatibleActivity

class MainActivity: FlutterActivity(), GamepadsCompatibleActivity {
    var keyListener: ((KeyEvent) -> Boolean)? = null
    var motionListener: ((MotionEvent) -> Boolean)? = null

    override fun dispatchGenericMotionEvent(motionEvent: MotionEvent): Boolean {
        if (motionListener?.invoke(motionEvent) == true) {
            return true
        }
        return super.dispatchGenericMotionEvent(motionEvent)
    }

    override fun dispatchKeyEvent(keyEvent: KeyEvent): Boolean {
        if (keyListener?.invoke(keyEvent) == true) {
            return true
        }
        return super.dispatchKeyEvent(keyEvent)
    }

    override fun registerInputDeviceListener(
      listener: InputManager.InputDeviceListener, handler: Handler?) {
        val inputManager = getSystemService(INPUT_SERVICE) as InputManager
        inputManager.registerInputDeviceListener(listener, null)
    }

    override fun registerKeyEventHandler(handler: (KeyEvent) -> Boolean) {
        keyListener = handler
    }

    override fun registerMotionEventHandler(handler: (MotionEvent) -> Boolean) {
        motionListener = handler
    }
}

```


## Windows troubleshooting

If you get a compilation error due to missing "GameInput.h" it
is because it doesn't find your [Windows SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-sdk/)
installation.

Make sure you have setup [Windows target for Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/windows/setup).
It is specifically the step to setup C++ for desktop development
that installs Windows SDK.

Neither package users (developers) nor end users needs GameInput
redistributable. This is because gamepads uses GameInput API v0
which is statically linked.

## Controller vibration

Use the device ID returned by `Gamepads.list()`:

```dart
if (await Gamepads.hasRumble(gamepad.id)) {
  await Gamepads.rumble(
    gamepad.id,
    lowFrequency: 0.6,
    highFrequency: 0.3,
    duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 500),
  );
}
```

Intensities range from 0 to 1. Effects replace the current effect immediately;
they do not queue. Both intensities at zero, or a zero duration, stop the effect.
Duration defaults to 500 ms and must be between 0 and 30 seconds. Invalid
parameters throw ArgumentError. Each native effect expires without requiring
a Dart timer. To stop early when a screen/session ends or your app backgrounds,
call `await Gamepads.stopRumble(gamepad.id)` from that lifecycle handler.

The boolean result reports whether the request was accepted, not whether the
physical motors actually moved. Missing hardware, OS support, or permissions
can make vibration unavailable. Web permission/focus failures may also occur
asynchronously after a request was accepted.

| Platform | Backend |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | GameInput device capabilities and SetRumbleState |
| macOS / iOS | GameController and Core Haptics (macOS 11 / iOS 14+) |
| Android | InputDevice vibrator(s) |
| Linux | FF_RUMBLE on the joystick's sibling evdev node |
| Web | GamepadHapticActuator dual-rumble |

Windows depends on the installed runtime and device support, with no new runtime
dependency. Apple uses controller actuators. Android supports separate motors on
some Android 12+ devices and combines strength otherwise; older APIs may provide
only on/off vibration. Linux requires write access to the event device. Web needs
browser/device support and foreground access; long effects are split into
segments of at most five seconds.

The example includes per-controller test and stop buttons. This API covers
ordinary dual-motor rumble, not adaptive triggers or arbitrary force feedback.
